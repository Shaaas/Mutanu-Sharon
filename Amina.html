    <h1>This Is Not My Story… But Sit Down, Let Me Tell You</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <p>Let me start with a disclaimer: this is not my story. If HR comes knocking, I don’t know anything. I wasn’t there. I am simply a translator of workplace suffering, putting corporate trauma into my own language, which is basically sarcasm mixed with caffeine, sprinkled with exaggeration, and deep-fried in pettiness.</p>

    <p>So let me tell you about Amina (name changed for her safety because this world is cruel and she still needs her job). Hehe!</p>

    <p>It was 6:59 AM when Amina’s peaceful slumber was violently interrupted. Not by an alarm. Not by a rooster. Not even by her landlord demanding rent. No; it was her phone vibrating with 36 unread WhatsApp messages from the office group.</p>

    <p>Now, Kenyan office WhatsApp groups are like cursed villages. They serve no real purpose except:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Good morning texts with emojis nobody asked for 🌞✨🌸</li>
      <li>Bible verses copied from Facebook aunties</li>
      <li>Screenshots of memes that died in 2018</li>
      <li>The occasional “urgent update” that ruins lives</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Amina scrolls through them, eyes half-closed. The first five are the usual suspects: “Good morning team,” “Blessed day ahead,” “God is good.” She’s already rolling her eyes. But then, the bombshell from The Boss:</p>

    <p>“Meeting moved forward to 8:15 AM.”</p>

    <p><strong>Moved? Forward? Sigh!</strong><br>
    The most violent phrase in the English language. Do you understand the wickedness it takes to move a meeting forward? People are still in their beds negotiating with God about waking up. Some are still deciding if today is worth faking malaria. But no. 8:15 AM.</p>

    <p>So Amina leaps out of bed like a soldier at boot camp. There’s no breakfast, no shower meditation, no moment to center her chakras. Just pure panic. She throws on lipstick like it’s war paint, stuffs a mandazi into her bag (priorities), and runs.</p>

    <p>At the matatu stage, it’s the usual chaos. Conductors screaming like auctioneers, matatus honking as if noise produces fuel, people pushing each other like it’s the Olympics. She dives into the first one she sees. Unfortunately, it’s one of those nganyas blasting old school dancehall, with neon lights flickering like a nightclub in full swing. It’s 7:30 AM and she’s already in a rave.</p>

    <p>The driver, clearly auditioning for Fast & Furious: Nairobi Drift, swerves through potholes like he’s dodging bullets. Amina clutches her bag, praying not for safety but that her wig remains intact. By some miracle (and a lot of potholes), she arrives at the office at 8:19 AM. Panting, sweating, and regretting her existence. Only to discover… The boss hasn’t even arrived yet.</p>

    <p>At 8:45, The Boss strolls in like Moses descending from the mountain, holding not stone tablets but a laptop bag full of nonsense. The meeting begins. Everyone sits there pretending to be alert, nodding like dashboard bobbleheads while secretly wishing for early retirement.</p>

    <p>Then comes the assignment:<br>
    “Team, we need the full quarterly report, with charts, analysis, and recommendations… by end of day.”</p>

    <p><strong>By end of day.</strong><br>
    Mind you, Amina is in communications. Her Excel skills stop at bolding text and adding borders. But in Kenyan offices, if you can spell “spreadsheet,” congratulations. You are now the Data Analyst.</p>

    <p>While Amina is trying to make sense of rows and columns, in slithers Janet from Marketing. Every office has a Janet. She doesn’t walk; she glides in gossip. Her perfume arrives before she does.</p>

    <p>“Eh, did you hear?” she whispers, eyes gleaming like a prophet.<br>
    “Hear what?” Amina mumbles, already stressed.<br>
    “Payroll issues. Some people aren’t getting paid on time.”</p>

    <p>And just like that, the entire office shifts into panic mode. Suddenly everyone has “urgent” banking to check. Screens are flashing with M-Pesa apps being refreshed like they hold the cure for stress. One guy even calls his cousin at KCB to “just confirm.” The productivity of the entire organization drops to zero. Just when Amina thinks it can’t get worse, IT makes their announcement:<br>
    “We’re doing a quick system update. Shouldn’t take long.”</p>

    <p><strong>Quick?! The boldness.</strong><br>
    In IT language, “quick” means your entire life is now on pause until further notice.</p>

    <p>Within minutes, the internet is gone. Computers freeze mid-document. People wander the office like displaced refugees, holding flash drives like sacred relics. One guy even starts pacing around saying, “Wueh, my deliverables,” like he’s in mourning.</p>

    <p>Amina takes this opportunity to go to the kitchen. Kenyan survival instinct. But of course, the kitchen is already full. Half the office is there “making tea,” but really, it’s the unofficial Parliament of Gossip. Today’s debate topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who HR is secretly dating</li>
      <li>Whether the company will collapse by December</li>
      <li>If it’s possible to stage a go-slow without anyone noticing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By the time the systems return (3:27 PM), Amina’s spreadsheet is still open but half her data has mysteriously vanished. She contemplates crying, but tears are expensive. Instead, she types with such aggression that even the keyboard looks scared.</p>

    <p>At 4:59 PM, with her blood sugar at zero and her will to live at negative ten, she starts packing up. Freedom is near. Home is calling. Then The Boss appears, peeking into her cubicle with a smile that should be illegal.<br>
    “Quick thing before you go…”</p>

    <p>No phrase in the workplace dictionary is more evil. Quick things are never quick. Quick things are why people miss matatus and end up negotiating with Uber drivers. Quick things are how you end up still at the office at 8 PM, staring at a screen, questioning why you didn’t become a farmer in Kitui instead. But she smiles. Because corporate life is 40% fake smiles, 30% tea, 20% gossip, and 10% actual work. She takes the file, nods, and continues her suffering.</p>

    <p>She finally leaves at 7:45 PM. The streets are dark, the matatus are full, and her stomach is staging a protest. She climbs into a matatu that looks one pothole away from retirement, sits between a man chewing loudly and a woman playing TikToks on full volume, and stares out the window. She asks herself the eternal question: “Why am I even here?”</p>

    <p>But when she gets home, exhausted, she still opens her laptop “just to finish one last thing.” Because rent. Because capitalism. Because Kenya. And the next morning? She does it all over again. Because in this country, survival is the job description.</p>

    <p><strong>This is not my story.</strong><br>
    But if you’ve ever worked in an office, you know it could be. The WhatsApp chaos, the payroll rumors, the IT betrayal, the boss with “quick things,” the colleagues surviving on tea and gossip, it’s universal. It’s tragic. It’s hilarious. And yet, somehow, we all keep showing up. Because at the end of the day, work drama is the one soap opera we don’t choose to watch — it chooses us.</p>
