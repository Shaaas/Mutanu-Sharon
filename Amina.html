    <h1>The Work Chronicles of Amina</h1>
    <p>Amina was your typical Nairobi office warrior — armed with an ID lanyard, a coffee mug that was more decorative than functional, and a smile that said “I’m fine” but really meant “if one more customer asks for a discount, I might scream.”</p>

    <h2>Episode One: The Monday Morning Showdown</h2>
    <p>Monday mornings in the office were like survival games. The printers jammed, the Wi-Fi ghosted everyone, and the boss strutted in with “urgent tasks” that were only urgent to him. Amina, clutching her cold mandazi, whispered a prayer and dove into customer complaints like a gladiator entering the colosseum.</p>

    <h2>Episode Two: The Great Lunch Hour Escape</h2>
    <p>Lunchtime was sacred. But Amina’s boss believed lunch was a “myth invented by lazy employees.” So she did what any genius would — disappeared into the washroom for “a meeting with HR” (aka inhaling pilau in secret).</p>

    <h2>Episode Three: The Drama of Deadlines</h2>
    <p>There was always that one colleague who submitted work late but still managed to shine in front of the boss. Amina? She met deadlines, triple-checked emails, and still somehow got blamed for the missing stapler. Office politics, ladies and gentlemen.</p>

    <h2>Episode Four: The Friday Night Miracle</h2>
    <p>By Friday, Amina had aged 10 years. But when the clock hit 5:01 PM, she transformed. Bag packed, lipstick reapplied, and Uber already ordered — Amina became a free woman, ready to trade office gossip for dance floors and nyama choma.</p>

    <p><em>Moral of the story?</em> The office may drain you, but with wit, resilience, and the occasional mandazi, you can survive anything. Amina did. And tomorrow, she’ll do it all over again — with style.</p>
