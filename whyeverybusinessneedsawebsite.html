    <h1>Why Every Business Needs a Website</h1>
    <p>In today’s world, if your business isn’t online, does it even exist? Spoiler: it doesn’t.</p>
    <p>Here’s the deal — a website is your digital storefront, your 24/7 sales pitch, and your credibility booster all rolled into one. No matter how small or fresh you are, a website sets you apart from the competition and gives your customers a place to find, trust, and buy from you.</p>

    <h2>1. First impressions count</h2>
    <p>People judge a business in seconds. A slick, easy-to-navigate website says you’re professional and serious. A missing or messy site? That’s a hard pass.</p>

    <h2>2. Reach beyond borders</h2>
    <p>With a website, your market isn’t just local — it’s global. No limits.</p>

    <h2>3. Showcase your brand and story</h2>
    <p>Your website tells your story your way. Your colors, your vibe, your values.</p>

    <h2>4. Control your narrative</h2>
    <p>Forget relying on social media algorithms or third parties. Your website is YOUR turf.</p>

    <h2>5. Open 24/7</h2>
    <p>No closing hours. Customers can check you out whenever inspiration strikes.</p>

    <p>So, if you’ve been thinking “I don’t need a website,” it’s time to flip that script. Because in business, visibility is power — and a website is your megaphone.</p>
