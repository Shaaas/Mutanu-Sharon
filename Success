  <article>
    <p>I’ve been thinking about success a lot lately. It’s funny—ask ten people what success means, and you’ll probably get ten different answers. Some will keep it short and sharp: “It’s about hitting your goals.” Others will drift into long reflections about meaning, values, and fulfillment. And then there are people like me, who get told we’re overthinking it whenever we go too deep. But am I really overthinking, or just refusing to settle for the surface-level definition?</p>

    <h2>The Straightforward View: Success as Hitting Goals</h2>
    <p>A friend recently told me his definition of success hasn’t changed in years: it’s about setting goals and hitting them. Simple. At first, I thought that sounded too vague, but when you break it down, it makes sense. Goals give us direction. They keep us focused. You know what you want, you go after it, you achieve it—boom, success. There’s a sense of accomplishment that comes with that clarity.</p>

    <p>This perspective is appealing because it’s measurable. Did you hit the goal or not? There’s no confusion. It can make you disciplined, focused, and motivated. In fact, I admire this simplicity because it removes the endless questioning. You don’t waste time dissecting every move—you just do.</p>

    <p>Funny Everyday Win: Think about it like laundry. If you manage to wash, dry, fold, AND actually put away your clothes all in one day—that’s basically the Olympics of adulting. You set a goal, you hit it, and in that moment, you’re successful. No TED Talk required.</p>

    <p>But here’s the catch: life isn’t always a checklist. What happens when you hit all your goals and still feel empty? Or when your goals change because you change? That’s where this version of success can start to feel a little shallow—though not because it’s wrong, but because it doesn’t always leave space for reflection.</p>

    <p>Even psychologists like Angela Duckworth, who popularized the concept of “grit,” admit that pure goal-chasing can become obsessive if the goals aren’t connected to deeper meaning. And if you look at cultures like Japan, success isn’t just measured by outcomes but by effort, harmony, and perseverance—showing that “hitting goals” is only one piece of the puzzle.</p>

    <p>This definition works beautifully for people who thrive on clarity and structure. Athletes, for example, live by this model—win the game, beat your personal record, stand on the podium. But even athletes will tell you: after the medal ceremony, the question creeps in—“Now what?” If your identity is only tied to the next goalpost, success risks becoming a treadmill: you’re running, but never arriving.</p>

    <h2>Adulting Reality Check: When Financial Stress Gets in the Way</h2>
    <p>Before we can get philosophical about success, there’s a reality check called adulting. Bills, rent, deadlines, and the endless grind have a funny way of hijacking our big-picture thinking. When you’re busy figuring out how to survive the month, “am I living aligned with my values?” feels like a luxury question. Financial stability acts as a baseline—once you’re not constantly stressed about making ends meet, you can finally explore what success truly means beyond survival. In other words, adulting forces most of us to hit pause on the abstract side of success until the basics are handled. And honestly, that’s not overthinking—it’s just smart planning.</p>

    <h2>The Reflective View: Success as Alignment</h2>
    <p>My own definition is a little more layered. To me, success is when what you value, what you do, and who you’re becoming all line up. It’s not about whether you ticked every box on your list—it’s about whether your list even mattered in the first place.</p>

    <p>I’ve seen people reach the milestones they thought would bring happiness—big house, dream job, financial stability—and still feel restless. Why? Because their goals weren’t aligned with their deeper values. They chased what society told them was “success,” only to find it didn’t fulfill them.</p>

    <p>This is where alignment matters. If my daily actions reflect my values, and if they’re helping me grow into the person I want to be, then I already feel successful—even before the big goals are checked off.</p>

    <p>Personal Reflection with Humor: I used to think success was waking up at 5 a.m., doing yoga, journaling, meditating, making a green smoothie, and then conquering the world before 9 a.m. Spoiler: I lasted three days. Then I realized—if success means living a life that fits me, maybe my version is waking up at 8:30, drinking coffee, and getting my brain working by writing something that matters. Alignment, not aesthetics.</p>

    <p>Yes, it sounds complex. It requires constant self-reflection, and sometimes that reflection feels heavy. But it saves me from empty wins, and that’s worth the effort.</p>

    <p>Alignment also has this sneaky way of forcing honesty. You can’t hide from yourself when you ask: Am I doing this because I want it, or because I’m trying to look successful to others? That single question can stop you from building a life that looks good but feels empty.</p>

    <p>In fact, philosophers like Aristotle called this eudaimonia—living in a way that fulfills your true nature, not just achieving external rewards. And in psychology, it echoes the idea of “self-concordant goals”: when your ambitions are rooted in your authentic self, you not only achieve more, but you’re happier when you do.</p>

    <h2>The Minimalist View: Keep It Simple</h2>
    <p>There’s another perspective too—the minimalist one. Some people genuinely don’t care about definitions at all. To them, success is simply being alive, being free, or having peace of mind. They don’t tie it to goals or values. Their philosophy is: Why complicate it? If you’re breathing, eating, and surrounded by people you love, you’re successful. That’s it.</p>

    <p>I respect this view because it strips away pressure. It makes success accessible in the everyday moments—a good laugh, a peaceful morning, a meal with family.</p>

    <p>Relatable Contrast: Honestly, sometimes I envy this mindset. Like when I meet someone who’s perfectly content sitting on their porch eating roasted maize, while I’m in my head wondering if I should be chasing three new certifications, a side hustle, and inner peace all at once. Their definition of success is “this moment.” Mine feels like a never-ending to-do list.</p>

    <p>But sometimes, it risks slipping into complacency. Without a vision or drive, you might be content, but not necessarily fulfilled. Peace without progress can turn into stagnation. Then again, progress without peace feels hollow. The minimalist reminds us: sometimes the deepest form of success is being okay right where you are.</p>

    <p>Interestingly, this echoes wisdom from Eastern philosophies like Taoism and Buddhism, where success is not conquest but balance, presence, and detachment. In those traditions, the ability to be satisfied with little is often considered the greatest achievement of all.</p>

    <h2>The Societal View: Success as Status</h2>
    <p>We can’t ignore the world around us. Society tends to sell us a flashy version of success: wealth, power, fame, or at least the appearance of “having it all together.” Social media amplifies this, making it easy to believe that success is only valid if it’s visible. The car, the vacations, the brand-name lifestyle.</p>

    <p>The danger here is that it pulls us into comparison. We start defining our success by other people’s highlight reels instead of our own truth. This version of success motivates some, but it exhausts many more.</p>

    <p>Here’s the thing: status-driven success often feels exciting in the moment but fragile in the long run. The moment the applause dies down or the algorithm shifts, you’re left wondering who you are without the spotlight. It’s not that wealth or recognition is wrong—it’s just that if they’re the only pillars holding up your sense of worth, they crumble too easily.</p>

    <p>Sociologists have argued for decades that this version of success—what Thorstein Veblen called “conspicuous consumption”—keeps people trapped in endless cycles of comparison. It explains why someone can earn more money than ever before and still feel behind: the yardstick keeps moving.</p>

    <h2>The Balance: Simplicity Meets Depth</h2>
    <p>So which definition is right? Maybe all of them. Maybe none. The truth is, success is personal. For some, it’s chasing and conquering goals. For others, it’s alignment and growth. For someone else, it’s just waking up and smiling at the life they’ve built.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the sweet spot lies in balance. Goals give you structure and momentum. Alignment makes sure those goals actually mean something. Minimalism keeps you grounded in gratitude. And awareness of society reminds you not to lose yourself in the noise.</p>

<p>Balance doesn’t mean having it all figured out. It means borrowing from each perspective at the right time. Sometimes you need the drive of a goal-setter, other times the peace of a minimalist, and often the self-reflection of alignment. Think of it like seasoning food—too much salt ruins the dish, but the right mix makes it perfect.</p>

<p>Even researchers back this up: studies show that people who combine goal achievement with gratitude and value-based living report higher life satisfaction than those who chase only one path. Balance isn’t a buzzword—it’s backed by science.</p>
<h2>My Answer Today</h2>
<p>If you asked me today what success is, I’d say this: Success is waking up, looking around at your life, and smiling that genuine smile. The kind that says, this feels right. It’s having goals that excite you, values that guide you, and loved ones that make the journey worth it. It’s not about overthinking. It’s about defining it in a way that feels true to you.</p>

<p>So no….. I don’t think I’m overthinking success. I think I’m finally defining it properly.</p>
