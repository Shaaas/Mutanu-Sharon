  <div class="sticky-header">This is not my story...</div>

  <div class="container">
    <p>This is not my story. I borrowed it, exaggerated it, and seasoned it with pure Kenyan chaos. Names are mostly fictional… or maybe not. Any resemblance to your aunties, uncles, cousins, or random boda boda drivers is purely coincidental… or not.</p>

    <p>“I never signed up to survive a wedding, but apparently, life had other plans. My cousin Lydia decided to marry Peter. You’d think weddings are simple, but in Kenya, weddings are war zones disguised as celebrations.</p>

    <p>From the moment the wedding was announced, chaos erupted. Aunties became unpaid coordinators, uncles became critics, and cousins became paparazzi. Every minor detail became a matter of national security. “The flowers are the wrong shade!” “The rice must be fluffy, not soggy!” “Where is the meat?!” Suddenly, everyone’s opinion mattered more than the bride’s sanity.</p>

    <p>The bridal shower a week before the wedding was the first prophecy of doom. Auntie Martha insisted on a theme no one understood, somewhere between blush pink and dusty rose. Someone brought a cake with the wrong number of tiers. Cousin Brenda, high on excitement and caffeine, yelled, “This is unacceptable!” The bride nearly cried. I sipped my tea quietly, knowing this was just the warm-up.</p>

    <p>Games went sideways. “Pin the veil on the bride” ended with Auntie Rose spinning and falling into the snack table. Cousin Brian tried a magic trick that set fire to a napkin. Auntie Grace almost fainted from the smoke. Somewhere, Uncle Patrick was attempting to smuggle beer in a diaper bag. The scene looked like a hurricane hit a beauty salon. Meanwhile, Lydia tried to smile, but every time a plate fell or someone screamed, her jaw tightened. I swear, her serenity was a miracle powered by adrenaline and fear.</p>

    <p>Lydia’s gown arrived a week before the wedding. It didn’t fit. Pins, stitching, prayers, and three emergency sewing kits were all involved. By Friday, she walked like she had trained for medieval combat. The seamstress assured us it was “fashionable” to look like a human corset. Every movement was a battle. Sitting was punishment, standing a challenge, bending impossible. Bridesmaids argued over accessories. Some wanted heels, some wanted flats. Janet, self-appointed wedding general, insisted on stilettos. “Sasa, if you fall, at least it’s for style!” she said. I muttered, “Yeah, and for a broken ankle too.”</p>

    <p>Auntie Martha kept bringing in extra tulle for “volume,” and I swear it multiplied by magic. The gown began to look like a tiny cloud trapped in fabric prison.</p>

    <h2>Morning of the Wedding</h2>

    <p>4 a.m. sharp. Janet started banging on doors. “Sharon! Wake up! Wake up! We have a wedding to survive!”</p>

    <p>Auntie Rose was ironing the bride’s gown like it had personally insulted her last year. Auntie Beatrice was on the phone, screaming at the florist for using “cream white” instead of “ivory white” flowers. Auntie Grace whispered, “As long as there’s rice, I am fine.” Big lie.</p>

    <p>The bride sat in the corner whispering, “Maybe I should just elope.” I almost joined her, but my stomach screamed, “No! Free pilau awaits!”</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, the kids were running wild. Flower girls smeared lotion on the walls. Ring bearers hid under chairs. Cousin Kevin tried to sneak vodka into a water bottle. The scene looked like a hurricane hit a daycare center.</p>

    <p>Even the dog got involved. He chased a toddler, knocked over a vase, and somehow got cake frosting in his fur. Auntie Martha yelled, “That dog has more sense than some of you!”</p>

    <p>Makeup was scheduled for 6 a.m., the artist arrived at 8:30 a.m., confidence levels over 9000, apology levels zero. “Don’t worry,” she said, “I will make you look like a queen.” Lydia whispered, “Which queen? Cleopatra or Elizabeth? Bridesmaids were traumatized with lilac eyeshadow. Hair stylists sprayed so much hairspray I nearly couldn’t breathe. My wig threatened mutiny. Auntie Beatrice kept criticizing, “Your eyeliner is too sharp.” The artist muttered, “It’s called precision.” Precision, she said, while Auntie Beatrice posted a photo to the family WhatsApp with the caption, “We need prayer.”</p>

    <h2>Transport Nightmare</h2>

    <p>We were supposed to leave at 9 a.m. Three minibuses were hired. Only one showed. Driver one blamed traffic in Kitengela. Traffic? Bro, the only traffic is cows crossing the road. Driver two didn’t answer his phone; rumor says he went to buy beer.</p>

    <p>We crammed thirty people into one bus. Sweat, wigs slipping, makeup melting. Cousin Tony sipped Smirnoff like communion wine. Kids screamed. Aunties fought over leg space. I prayed for divine intervention.</p>

    <p>The journey took twice as long as expected because Uncle Patrick insisted on stopping for “emergency snacks” three times. By the time we arrived, my hair looked like a melted candle. We arrived late. Father Dominic’s side-eye could have killed. The bride walked in while a toddler screamed, “Mummy, I want to poop!” five times. Choir tried to drown him out; epic fail. Peter almost said, “Take me as your lawful awful husband” during vows. The congregation collectively held their breath. Flower girls tripped over carpets. Petals flew like shrapnel. Auntie Martha yelled, “Watch the children!” The children ignored her.</p>

    <p>Guests were an army of aunties, uncles, and cousins. Auntie Beatrice whispered to Auntie Grace, “Her shoes are cheap.” Auntie Grace responded with a death stare. Cousin Brenda kept taking selfies, blocking everyone’s view. Meanwhile, the pastor’s wife whispered, “Who even is this?” I whispered back, “Survivors of chaos, ma’am.” People fought for chairs like they were gold. Auntie Rose nearly slapped Kevin’s cousin for taking “her spot.” MC begged, “Hii ni kiti tu, si urithi wa shamba.”</p>

    <p>Caterers brought rice, chapati, chicken, goat, pilau. Half the meat disappeared before it reached the tables. Uncle Patrick acted innocent, but his stomach betrayed him. Auntie Grace fainted at the sight of empty meat trays.</p>

    <p>If there’s no booze, is it even a wedding? Uncle Patrick and his boys smuggled bottles to the parking lot. One had the audacity to say, “We are safeguarding it.” Bro, you are just getting drunk in private. The DJ started with gospel. Drunk uncles danced to “Nani Kama Wewe.” Uncle Patrick attempted breakdancing, knees betrayed him. Cousin Sheila thought she was Beyoncé and nearly knocked over the cake. Auntie Martha challenged anyone who dared to step on her toes.</p>

    <p>Auntie Beatrice started with Lydia as a baby. Ten minutes in, people begged her to stop. Uncle Mike gave advice: “Marriage is like pilau; sometimes you find kachumbari inside.” Cousin Kevin gave a toast while holding a beer bottle like a microphone. Chaos ensued.</p>

    <p>The cake: three-tiered, majestic, edible art. Until Cousin Kevin, drunk off his face, tripped. Collapse. Splat. Gone. Bride screamed. Auntie Rose crossed herself. Kevin licked frosting off his elbow. Kids dove into the rubble. Photographer snapped it all. Iconic.</p>

    <p>After the formalities, uncles disappeared for an unauthorized after-party. Cousin Brenda did karaoke. Auntie Martha started a dance-off. Shoes flew. Drinks spilled. Cousin Brian flirted with the photographer, nearly toppling the dessert table. Auntie Grace lectured everyone on proper behavior while sipping whiskey.</p>

    <h2>Next-Day Gossip</h2>

    <p>WhatsApp exploded. Photos of Auntie Beatrice scolding a waiter went viral. Uncle Patrick’s dance-floor wipeout became a meme. Cousin Sheila’s Beyoncé audition circulated in the family chat. Everyone had a story. Everyone was traumatized.</p>

    <p>Subplots; Cousin Brian spilled juice on Auntie Rose during a flirt attempt. Uncle Joe stole extra pilau, got caught, and performed a dramatic apology. Flower girls cried during every speech. Ushers argued over seating; one got in a fistfight. MC had a meltdown, switching between Swahili and English.</p>

    <p>Despite all this, Lydia and Peter smiled through it all. They clung to each other for dear life. Photographer captured horror, joy, and exhaustion in one frame. By evening: Bride was barefoot, groom’s suit was ruined, uncle Patrick was missing and Cousin Sheila still twerking.</p>

    <h2>Moral</h2>

    <p>Weddings are for warriors. Gladiators. Anyone who can survive without food, withstand auntie scorn, and dodge drunk uncles. Lydia and Peter survived. We survived. I survived, barely. And yes, pilau was eaten. Always pilau.</p>
