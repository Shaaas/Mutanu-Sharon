  <h1>This Is Not My Story‚Ä¶ But Sit Down, Let Me Tell You</h1>

  <p>Let me start with a disclaimer: this is not my story. If HR comes knocking, I don‚Äôt know anything. I wasn‚Äôt there. I am simply a translator of workplace suffering, putting corporate trauma into my own language, which is basically sarcasm mixed with caffeine, sprinkled with exaggeration, and deep-fried in pettiness.</p>

  <p>So let me tell you about Amina (name changed for her safety because this world is cruel and she still needs her job). Hehe!</p>

  <p>It was 6:59 AM when Amina‚Äôs peaceful slumber was violently interrupted. Not by an alarm. Not by a rooster. Not even by her landlord demanding rent. No; it was her phone vibrating with 36 unread WhatsApp messages from the office group.</p>

  <p>Now, Kenyan office WhatsApp groups are like cursed villages. They serve no real purpose except:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Good morning texts with emojis nobody asked for üåû‚ú®üå∏</li>
    <li>Bible verses copied from Facebook aunties</li>
    <li>Screenshots of memes that died in 2018</li>
    <li>The occasional ‚Äúurgent update‚Äù that ruins lives</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Amina scrolls through them, eyes half-closed. The first five are the usual suspects: ‚ÄúGood morning team,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlessed day ahead,‚Äù ‚ÄúGod is good.‚Äù She‚Äôs already rolling her eyes. But then, the bombshell from The Boss:</p>

  <blockquote>‚ÄúMeeting moved forward to 8:15 AM.‚Äù</blockquote>

  <p>Moved? Forward? Sigh! The most violent phrase in the English language. Do you understand the wickedness it takes to move a meeting forward? People are still in their beds negotiating with God about waking up. Some are still deciding if today is worth faking malaria. But no. 8:15 AM.</p>

  <p>So
